# Argumentative Visualization

## Overview
In this repo, I have created two data visualizations that argue for opposing viewpoints on the controversial topic of "Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) vs. DC Extended Universe (DCEU)." Both visualizations use the same dataset, which includes movies released by these two cinematic universes from 2003 to 2019. The dataset attributes used for comparison are Metascore ratings, IMDB ratings, budget, and worldwide gross.

## Dataset Source:
Kaggle - Marvel vs. DC (https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/marvel-vs-dc)

## Left Chart: Top IMDB Score Over the Years

**Argument**: The left chart aims to argue in favor of DCEU by highlighting the top IMDB-rated movies over the years. In this chart, MCU movies are represented by the red line, while DCEU movies are represented by the gray line.

## Rhetorical Techniques Used:

**Omission:** Irrelevant attributes like Minutes, Opening Weekend USA, and Gross USA are omitted for clarity.

**Anchoring:** A horizontal region highlight is added to emphasize the top-rated movies, supporting the DCEU argument.

**Data Provenance:** Data from IMDB is used to differentiate and identify the winners, enhancing data credibility.

**Cultural Codes:** Colors are used to represent the movies, aligning with the base color of their respective logos.

**Analysis:** The left chart shows that DCEU movies have secured some of the highest IMDB ratings, with titles like "The Dark Knight Rises," "Joker," and "The Dark Knight" earning top spots. This suggests that DCEU has produced movies that are highly regarded by audiences, making a strong case for its quality.

## Right Chart: Budget vs. Overall Gross

**Argument:** The right chart argues in favor of MCU by comparing the budget vs. overall gross of movies from both cinematic universes.

## Rhetorical Techniques Used:

**Omission:** Irrelevant attributes are excluded for clarity.

**Data Provenance:** Data from Metascore is used to differentiate and identify the winners, enhancing data credibility.

**Cultural Codes:** Colors are used to represent the movies, aligning with the base color of their respective logos.

**Analysis:** The right chart presents a scatter plot with MCU movies showing significantly higher returns compared to DCEU. For instance, "Avengers: Endgame" achieved returns nearly 8 times its budget, while some DCEU movies like "Jonah Hex" had poor returns, earning only $10.9M against a $47M budget. This suggests that MCU has been more successful in terms of financial returns.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, both visualizations provide arguments supporting opposing viewpoints in the MCU vs. DCEU debate.

The left chart emphasizes DCEU's strength by showcasing its top-rated movies, implying that DCEU produces highly-rated films.
The right chart supports MCU by illustrating its superior financial performance, suggesting that MCU movies generate higher returns.
Personal Position: Personally, I believe that MCU is the winner in this comparison. MCU has consistently produced financially successful movies with strong returns and maintained a good average IMDB rating, making it a more appealing cinematic universe.
